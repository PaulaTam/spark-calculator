# Spark Calculator
This is a project to create calculators for various gacha games to track how many rolls/pulls a person has + guide to any additional funds that may be unclaimed. This way, a person can track how close they are to sparking a character or reaching hard pity/guaranteed pity.

# What this project contains:
## Roll/Pull Count
For each calculator, the total amount of rolls would usually be displayed out of the hard pity count, guaranteed pity count, or number of rolls needed to spark if applicable. (e.g. If the amount needed to spark is 300, then the amount of rolls will be displayed as "xxx/300" where "xxx" represents your current amount of rolls.)

If the game does not utilize these systems, then the number displayed will just be the amount of rolls you currently have.

## Farming Guide (?)
Depending on the game, there may be easy ways to gain some currency. This section will be in an another tab separate from the calculator.

Any currency/rolls gained from Login/Dailies depends on the game and may not be included if there is too much variance in the amount gained per day / on a consistent basis.

Any currency/rolls gained from in-game events may or may not be included depending on how consistent the rewards are each event or how consistent the event appears. 

Any currency/rolls gained from other sources (e.g. Maintenance Compensation, IRL Events, Freebies) are not included.

## How to use the calculators
- Enter in the amount of currency you have in the respective game calculator.
- The calculator will then display the number of rolls you have depending on your input.

# Additional Info
As I definitely don't know every single gacha game out there, this project will start off with calculators for Granblue Fantasy, Genshin Impact, and Project Sekai (EN). (These are some of the games I currently play and also need a calculator for, so I will prioritize them.)

Other games that may be implemented in the future:
- Ensemble Stars (JP)
- Tears of Themis (EN)
- Cookie Run Kingdom (EN)
- Arknights (EN)
