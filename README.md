# Spark Calculator
This is a project to create calculators for various gacha games to track how many rolls/pulls a person has + guide to any additional funds that may be unclaimed. This way, a person can track how close they are to sparking a character or reaching hard pity/guaranteed pity.

# TERMS YOU MAY NOT KNOW
"Pity" refers to the "Pity System" in gacha games, which is basically a safety net to guarantee the player that they would get a featured character/unit at a certain number of rolls/pulls. Different games have different pity systems, so some terms may vary.

"Hard Pity" usually refers to the maximum number of rolls needed to get a banner/high rarity character. "Guaranteed Pity" usually refers to the amount of rolls needed to guarantee the character you want, though this is not applicable to all games.

"Spark" comes from the gacha game Granblue Fantasy when they implemented a system that allowed a player to choose the character they want (from a list) after 300 rolls. This method of a pity is referred as the "Spark System".

# Roll/Pull Count
If the game uses a pity system, the total amount of rolls would be displayed out of the hard pity count and/or guaranteed pity count if applicable. (e.g. If the hard pity count is 100, then the amount of rolls will be displayed as "xxx/100".)

If the game uses a spark system, the total amount of rolls would be out of the amount of rolls needed to spark. (e.g. If the total amount of rolls needed to spark is 300, then the amount of rolls will be displayed as "xxx/300".)

# Farming Guide/Tracker (?)
Depending on the game, there may be easy ways to gain some currency (usually these are missions you can only do once).

Underneath the calculator would be a checklist of ways to get free currency/rolls with a "Claimed" option to see what you have already claimed. The amount of currency/rolls unclaimed will be a cumulative total included as a separate value in the calculator for people to see the *possible* amount of total rolls they may have after farming. (Please not that this does **not** take into account the amount of time it takes to farm.)

Any currency/rolls gained from Login/Dailies depends on the game and may not be included if there is too much variance in the amount gained per day.

Any currency/rolls gained from in-game events may or may not be included depending on how consistent the rewards are each event. 

Any currency/rolls gained from other sources (e.g. Maintenance Compensation, IRL Events, Freebies) are not included.

# Additional Info
As I definitely don't know every single gacha game out there, this project will start off with calculators for Granblue Fantasy, Genshin Impact, and Project Sekai (EN). (These are some of the games I currently play and also need a calculator for.)

Other games that may be implemented in the future:
Ensemble Stars (JP)
Idolish7 (JP)
Tears of Themis (EN)
Cookie Run Kingdom (EN)
Arknights (EN)
